I was given a task to find the "best" cookie on a challenge site.

The first thing I did was use `curl` to check for any cookies set by the server.

By sending a `GET` request to the URL, I found that the server set a cookie called "name" with the value `-1`.

From there, I tried modifying the cookie and iterated through a range of values, hoping to find one that returned something different from the default response.

When I set the cookie value to `0` and made the request, the response said that the cookie wasnâ€™t special, so I continued testing with a loop.

After trying values from 1 to 20, I found that when the value was set to `18`, the response changed significantly.

It mentioned a flag and provided a clear hint, so I knew that was the one I was looking for; the flag.

It was a fun exercise of interacting with the server via cookies and figuring out which one was "special".

Code:
```
root@LAPTOP-GEM5SRL1:~# curl -s http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/ -I | grep Cookie
Set-Cookie: name=-1; Path=/
root@LAPTOP-GEM5SRL1:~# curl -s http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/ -H "Cookie: name=0;" -L | grep -i Cookie
    <title>Cookies</title>
            <h3 class="text-muted">Cookies</h3>
          <!-- <strong>Title</strong> --> That is a cookie! Not very special though...
            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>I love snickerdoodle cookies!</b></p>
root@LAPTOP-GEM5SRL1:~# for i in {1..20}; do
