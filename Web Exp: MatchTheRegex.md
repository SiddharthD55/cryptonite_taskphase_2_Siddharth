I tackled this challenge where I was greeted with a website. My task was to provide some input to extract a flag. Well, I jumped right into the process.

#### **Initial Observations:**
The website seemed straightforward, but I knew that the real challenge lay beneath the surface. It was clear that the input field was the key to unlocking the flag.

#### **Source Code Exploration:**

I delved into the source code of the webpage. This is often where hidden gems lie—functions, scripts, and comments that aren’t immediately visible.

In the source code, I stumbled upon a function named `send_request`. This function was crucial as it handled the input and communicated with the server. It was like finding a treasure map.

#### **Regex Pattern and Input Testing:**
One key observation was that the input was matched against a regular expression (Regex) pattern: `/flag`. This indicated that the input needed to meet specific criteria to reveal the flag.

Armed with this knowledge, I began experimenting with different inputs. Knowing that "flag" was a common term in CTF challenges, I decided to give it a try.

#### **The Eureka Moment:**
I typed in `picoCTF` as my input, which is a common prefix in many CTF flags.

#### **What I Learned:**
1. **Source Code Analysis:** Diving into the source code can provide crucial insights and hidden clues.
2. **Understanding Regex:** Familiarizing yourself with regular expressions is essential for tackling many CTF challenges.
3. **Leveraging Common Conventions:** Knowing common CTF patterns and conventions can guide your approach effectively.
4. **Iterative Testing:** Be prepared to test and iterate with different inputs. Each attempt brings you closer to the solution.

This challenge was a fantastic learning experience. It reinforced the importance of thorough exploration and leveraging common patterns in CTF challenges.
